"""Closed-loop VLA primitives — the only tools that call the Pi0.5 policy.

Both override ``obs['task_descriptions']`` with a sub-instruction and run the
policy for a bounded number of action chunks. They differ in what counts as
success: ``pi0_pick`` uses a proprioception heuristic (post-descent lift +
gripper closure), while ``pi0_doubled`` reports only the official LIBERO
termination predicate.
